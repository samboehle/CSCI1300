set days to 0
when days is less than 365

set input_seconds to user_seconds
set days to 0
set hours to 0
set minutes to 0
set seconds to 0
set extra_time to 0

input_seconds divided by 86400 set equal to days, set remainder to extra_time
if days is less than 1 then set days to 0, and extra_time to input seconds

extra_time divided by 3600 set equal to hours
if hours is less than 1 then set hours to 0, set extra_time to extra_time + remainder
else set remainder to extra_time

extra_time divided by 60 set equal to minutes
if minutes is less then 1 then set minutes to 0, set extra_time to extra_time + remainder
else set remainder to extra_time

set extra_time to seconds

output "The time is" days "days," hours "hours," minutes "minutes, and" seconds "seconds."
